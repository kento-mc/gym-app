Self reflection - Grading Spectrum Level
  I think I have achieved an outstanding level based on the specific points in the grading spectrum, but I wouldn't give myself 100. I think 90 is probably fair. 

  My data model includes student and premium members and relatively robust options for querying assessments. The API is fully-featured. The member menu includes progress sub-menu options with well-formated information returned. All unit tests passed.

  I don't think I've implemented data input validation in the most efficient, or totally sufficient ways everywhere, notably with the chosenPackage method implementation.

A statement of how much of the application specification you implemented.
  I attempted to implement everything in the spec, and I think I got everything working.

Any extra features you wish to bring to the assessors attention, i.e. extra functionality, Java syntax not covered in the lectures, non-standard Libraries used
	I implemented delete functionality for members and assessments...
